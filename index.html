      <h1>Russia has banned a festival celebrating gay fish.</h1>
      <p><img src="img/help.png"></p>
      <p>The Arkhangelsk local authorities has banned a rally in the city in honor of gay smelt – a type of small fish – which was being planned for 25 January.
         Gay rights activists were hoping to hold ‘gay fish’ banners and placards, as well as calling for a ban on overfishing this staple of the Russian diet.
         This isn’t completely crazy. St Petersburg holds an annual Festival of Smelt every May which has been held off-and-on for over 300 years.
         While the idea of honoring gay fish is clearly intended to be a joke, it was also actually pretty cunning.
